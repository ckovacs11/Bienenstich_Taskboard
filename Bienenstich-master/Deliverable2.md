# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Create your own Scrumboard.

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Steven Faye

**Git Master**: Curtis Kovacs

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:** To implement core scrum board functionality.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  7

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**
We added 9 stories to this sprint
> #8 - As a user I'd like for the icons to match what the program is supposed to do so that I can navigate the program better.
> #9 - As a developer I want the Update Version and Build Number to be correct to always see the correct version and build information.
> #96 - As a user i want to be able to categorize tasks into categories such as: new, in progress, ready for test, closed and needs info.
> #97 - As a Developer I want to reverse engineer Memoranda to better understand the dependencies.
> #98 - As a user I want to be able to add User Stories to the backlog so I can bring them into a sprint later
> #99 - As a user i want to be able to add team members to the team panel to know who is in which project team
> #100 - As a user I want to be able to view all user stories in a single sprint and see overall sprint progress
> #101 - As a user i dont want to see unnecessary buttons on the daily items panel so its easier to see the items i want
> #102 - As a developer I want to create documentation describing the overall workflow of the program

**Why did you add exactly these US?**
we think these user stories cover what core scrum board functionality should be.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**
Several stoies are easier and share functionality between them such as saving functionality to projects. The initial discovery of these tasks will be more difficult but they will translate well into other stories.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**
Yes the team feels confident moving forward.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z2gajj9isk

> Answer the following questions as a team.

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We finished some of the core functionality of the scrum board, and the UI
is close to being complete, so we think this was valuable work.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We did put a lot of work into the program this sprint. Some of us had a bit of
difficulty juggling the requirements with other courses requirements but we still
were able to put consistent work into the project.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We would honestly say probably not. Unfortunately we bit off a bit more than
we could chew with user stories this sprint. This is partially due to the fact
that we lost yet another team member and now down to three, but interference from
other courses didn't help either.

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Unfortunately not really. We wanted to get basic functionality implemented
and while we made good strides forward we didn't quite fully get there.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No. We completed a lot of the tasks but needed more time to complete the
whole user stories.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Personal time constraints in addition to losing another team member combined
with an ambitious sprint resulted in us not fully achieving our goals this sprint.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> While our work definitely increased toward the back half of the sprint, some
of that was due to the front half of the sprint loaded with other exams and coursework.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We think so. The functionality we did complete is important for creating a
working scrum board.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We think we could estimate better the amount of work that we could get done
in the next sprint.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We are a little bit bummed out because we feel like we could probably be
getting a lot of noticeable progress if we never lost half our team but optimistic
that we can deliver working features by the end of the project.
