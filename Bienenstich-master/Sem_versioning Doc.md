Semantic Versioning

All versions should be in the format: X.X.X where "X".X.X is the major version
of the software with incompatible API changes. X."X".X is the minor version such
 as a change that is backwards compatible. X.X."X" is a patch such as a minor
bug fix. We will start the version number at 0.1.1. At the end of Sprint 2 we
will hopefully be able to release the 1.0.0 version.
