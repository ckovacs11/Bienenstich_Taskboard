# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Create your own Scrumboard.

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Alexandra Hollingsworth

**Git Master**: Kacie Moden

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:** To Better Understand the main features of Memoranda, fix obvious bugs, and make some small UI changes.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**
We added two User Stories to the Sprint.
\#19 As a user I want to be able to categorize tasks into categories such as: new, in progress, ready for test, closed, and needs info.
\#17 As a user I want to be able to single click on a new project to select to make opening projects more intuitive.

**Why did you add exactly these US?**
We think completing these User Stories will bring the look and feel closer to a Scrumboard.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**
Most of them don't seem too difficult, and the more difficult User Stories we can work together to complete.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**
Yes the team feels confident moving forward.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0qQKpna8hg

> Answer the following questions as a team.

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We added some key scrumboard elements and made big UI changes. We some quality of life changes as well that we think the program needed. We started transitioning more towards a scrumboard look and feel. The key functionality is still not implemented but it is something we will work on in the coming sprints.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> I think we worked hard on the UI this sprint, but we could have made more progress with functionality. We think a lot of this has to do with figuring out the class structure. The goal of the sprint was to understand memoranda better, and we think we achieved that.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We think we did except for completing all of the UML diagrams completely. We fixed a lot of bugs and started to make broader changes for future expectations.

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, because our goal was to understand memoranda better and fix the most obvious bugs which we believe we did.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> We did not complete all of our user stories. We did not finish US7 because we did not complete all of the class diagrams. We also did not finish US19 because we didn't implement the task progress functionality and taskboard layout.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> One of our team members took a large user story on by herself and then dropped the course. It was difficult to see where she was on the US because she hadn't pushed her branch yet. Demarco was a bit busy last week and was unable to help fully with the Sprint.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Our team members worked at different paces depending on their schedules. Steven and Alexandra worked a lot at the beginning of the sprint while Curtis and Kacie worked more towards the end of the sprint. Our burndown chart revealed that the rate of work being done was fairly consistent.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We definitely did because we fixed a lot of bugs. We also started to create the skeleton of what a scrumboard should be.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We should be more consistent with assigning a task and then finishing that task within a timely manner. We should also be more specific with more tasks. We can also alter tasks within the sprint to be more specific.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Even though we have a small team we feel as though we can make progress with the program going forward.
