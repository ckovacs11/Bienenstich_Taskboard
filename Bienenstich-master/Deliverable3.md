# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Create your own scrumboard

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Curtis Kovacs

**Git Master**: Alexandra Hollingsworth

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:** Clean up core functionality for a fully functioning product

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> We felt with very limited people our focus was to get key functionality in place and have an attainable goal

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We learned from our last sprint how overloaded we made it and with members dropping, we were unable to finish. We planned this sprint for 3 people and kept much more reasonable expectations

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/0Hma4skSZZM

> Answer the following questions as a team.

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We continued to add sprint functionality and added a lot of value this sprint. Teams are now working and showing up correctly, User stories can now be added to the backlog, and Tasks are now being created properly

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Our team had a problem with balancing other classes and heavy workloads, so we did not put in a consistent work flow. We did add a lot of value at the end of this sprint, however we did not properly follow the agile process of consistent work.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We partially met customer expectations. If we had one more sprint we could fully meet those expectations. With a very small team and very limited time during the last sprint, we struggled to complete all the work we planned on completing.

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> No

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Our team struggled balancing other difficult classes, and large assignments at the end of this class. Because of that, we were unable to put the time required into our group project. Unfortunately, all team members ran into the same problem at the same time, so work was not done consistently through the sprint.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> No

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes. We added a lot of functionality this sprint including the ability to add user stories to the backlog, add teams, and have the newest version of tasks working properly.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> If there was another sprint, we feel we could have done much better about consistent workflow.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> The team feels good about our last deliverable however wish we had more time to clean it up the way we want to.
